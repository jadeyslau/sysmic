# Can you explain the reason why in the example given in subsection 5.2.2 we set minimum to be equal to the first value of our array instead of, for instance zero or some other number?
# Store your answer in a variable and display it using print() .

answer = "We set the minimum as the first number of the array as it is a member of the array we are interested in. We already know that this number exists in the array so we can use it as a comparison in the for loop to find the minimum."
print(answer)

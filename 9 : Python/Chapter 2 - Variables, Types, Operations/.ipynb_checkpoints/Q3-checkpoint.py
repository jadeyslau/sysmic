# We have an enzyme whose reaction velocity is v = 50 mol ⋅ L−1 ⋅ s−1 at the substrate concentration of [S] = Km = 2.5 mol ⋅ L−1 . Work out the maximum reaction velocity or Vmax for this enzyme using the Michaelis-Menten equation:

v  = 50
S  = 2.5
Km = 2.5

vmax = v * (S+Km)
print(vmax)
print('hi')
